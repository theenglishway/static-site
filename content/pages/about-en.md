Am I supposed to talk about me in here ?

... well no !

I really cherish the relative anonimacy that the web provides, and I will take
care not to reveal more about me than what can actually interest some other

Suffice to say I am lucky enough (at the time of writing, July 2018) to have
the opportunity to have been working full-time on a projet of mine since almost
a year, after a few years as an employee in the embedded systems' field.

I will mainly use that blog as a note-book to share my discoveries and
experience in domains that were totally unknown to me before and that I am
exploring little-by-little :

* Web development
* Project management
* Entrepreneurship

I might also talk in more details about my project, and write general articles
regarding society or the web as a whole.

It's a nice win-win situation if my writings are not only useful to me (as a way
of organizing my thoughts and keeping track of my own route) but can also turn
to be useful to those who will stumble onto them !

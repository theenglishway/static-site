If you want to suscribe to everything I publish, just use the
<span><i class="fa fa-rss"></i></span>  icon in the menu
(on the left or top of your screen, depending on its size).

If you are not interested in everything I say, you can subscribe to feeds by
category :

* [3615 ma vie mon oeuvre][3615]
* [C'est pas si compliqué que ça!][not-that-hard]

### Wait a minute, what's an RSS feed ?

It's a shame if you only just now discover what an RSS feed is, since it's an
extremely convenient tool that you should use for all the content you enjoy to
follow. Have a look at that very clear video to get a glimpse of it.

I myself use [Feedly][feedly] as a client ; it's one of the most popular and
it has several practial advantages even though you'll have to surrend to the
GAFA galaxy :

* Login using your Google or Facebook account
* Accessible through both the [website][feedly], or the
[Android][feedly-android] and [Apple][feedly-ios] mobile applications.
